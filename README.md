Module 11 Challenge Submission

For this challenge, I have created a website that displays information on UFO sightings in the United States. Through the course of the module, I created a website that displays generic UFO information and images and imports a JSON data file of UFO sightings, displaying them in a table using javascript and including a function to filter by the date of the sighting.

My challenge submission builds on the website created during the module by adding javascript table filtering options for four additional variables (City, State, Country, and Shape), on top of the original Date filter function. Additionally, I coded the website so that it would reset the filter list after every button click so that any table filters could be reset without having to refresh the page.

For further development, I would recommend adding a feature to scrape real-time UFO sighting data, or to periodically update the data.js file with recent UFO sightings.
